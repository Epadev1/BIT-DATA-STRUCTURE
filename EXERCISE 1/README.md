**Assignment about integer, string, boolean, array, list and dictionaries 
PROJECT 85: FISHERY DAILY CATCH USINg PYTHON**

1.INTEGERS: 
Here in integer, I have daily quantity of fish caught daily and i compute its total=140kg,its average=23.333kg, minimum quantity is 10kg and maximum quantity is 40 kg.It requires computing statistical measures including the total, average, minimum, and maximum values to assess the daily catch performance.

2.**strings:** 
Here in string,I compute report of two fstring by summarising the total daily quantity of 140 kg and it's average of 23.33kg and , ensuring the data is presented in a clear and concise manner for easy interpretation.

3.**Booleans:** 
Here in boolean,I applied condition that if average exceeds the thresold and i print the message called status:'above standard or below the standard' and i saw message that "status:it is below standard" because average not exceed the threshold.

4.**LISTS:** 
Here in list, I maintain a list of items for fishery daily catch and i added new element called "50" and i remove an existing element by condition and then i sort the elements before and after modification

5.ARRAYs: 
Here in array contained an element with fixed sized and i compute the sum and compare the sum of array and list,highlighting the differences and benefits of using arrays for numeric data storage.

6.**DICTIONARIES:** 
Here in a dictionary I have a fields called id, name, and values and i updated value of catfish of 45kg to 15kg and i deleted value for tilapia on id 1 and i found total value accross all records is 83kg. showcasing dictionary-based data organization and manipulation.
